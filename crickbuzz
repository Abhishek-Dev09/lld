Designing a system like Cricbuzz involves creating a robust architecture, database schema, and flow to handle real-time cricket scores, news, commentary, and user interactions. Below is a high-level design for the system:

1. High-Level Architecture
The system can be divided into the following components:

User Interface (Frontend):

Web and mobile apps for users to view scores, news, and commentary.

Supports features like live scores, match schedules, player stats, and notifications.

Backend Services:

Score Service: Fetches and updates live scores from data providers.

News Service: Manages cricket-related news articles and updates.

Commentary Service: Handles real-time ball-by-ball commentary.

User Service: Manages user profiles, preferences, and notifications.

Analytics Service: Tracks user behavior and provides insights.

Data Providers:

Third-party APIs or data feeds for live scores, player stats, and match schedules.

Database:

Stores match data, user data, news, and commentary.

Caching Layer:

Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data like live scores and commentary.

Message Queue:

Kafka or RabbitMQ for handling real-time updates and notifications.

Notification Service:

Sends push notifications and emails for match updates, news, and alerts.

CDN:

For serving static assets like images, videos, and news articles.

2. Database Schema
The database schema will consist of multiple tables to store match data, user data, and other related information.

Tables:
Matches:

match_id (PK)

team1_id (FK to Teams)

team2_id (FK to Teams)

venue

start_time

end_time

status (e.g., "upcoming", "live", "completed")

Teams:

team_id (PK)

team_name

country

Players:

player_id (PK)

player_name

team_id (FK to Teams)

role (e.g., batsman, bowler)

Scorecards:

scorecard_id (PK)

match_id (FK to Matches)

team_id (FK to Teams)

total_runs

wickets

overs

Ball-by-Ball Commentary:

commentary_id (PK)

match_id (FK to Matches)

over

ball

batsman_id (FK to Players)

bowler_id (FK to Players)

runs

wicket (boolean)

commentary_text

News:

news_id (PK)

title

content

published_date

author

Users:

user_id (PK)

username

email

password_hash

preferences (e.g., favorite teams, players)

Notifications:

notification_id (PK)

user_id (FK to Users)

message

timestamp

status (e.g., "sent", "read")

User Preferences:

preference_id (PK)

user_id (FK to Users)

favorite_team_id (FK to Teams)

favorite_player_id (FK to Players)

3. System Flow
Live Scores:

Data providers push live scores to the Score Service.

The service updates the Scorecards table and caches the data in Redis.

The frontend fetches live scores from the cache.

Commentary:

Data providers push ball-by-ball commentary to the Commentary Service.

The service stores the data in the Ball-by-Ball Commentary table and publishes updates to Kafka.

The frontend subscribes to Kafka topics to display real-time commentary.

News:

The News Service fetches cricket news from data providers or internal editors.

News articles are stored in the News table and served to users via the frontend.

User Interactions:

Users can sign up, log in, and set preferences (e.g., favorite teams, players).

The User Service manages user data and preferences.

The Notification Service sends alerts based on user preferences (e.g., match updates, news).

Analytics:

The Analytics Service tracks user behavior (e.g., pages visited, notifications clicked).

Data is stored in a separate analytics database for reporting and insights.

4. Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Native (for mobile apps)

Backend: Node.js, Python, or Java (Spring Boot)

Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL

Caching: Redis

Message Queue: Kafka or RabbitMQ

Notification Service: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or AWS SNS

CDN: Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront

Hosting: AWS, GCP, or Azure

5. Scalability Considerations
Use sharding for the database to handle large volumes of match and user data.

Implement load balancing for backend services to distribute traffic.

Use auto-scaling for backend services and caching layers.

Optimize database queries and use indexing for faster reads.

6. Example API Endpoints
GET /matches: Fetch list of upcoming/live matches.

GET /matches/{match_id}/scorecard: Fetch scorecard for a specific match.

GET /matches/{match_id}/commentary: Fetch ball-by-ball commentary.

POST /users: Create a new user.

GET /news: Fetch latest cricket news.

POST /notifications: Send notifications to users.

This design provides a scalable and modular architecture for a system like Cricbuzz. It can be extended further based on specific requirements and features.

Thank you for sharing the reference link! Based on the structure and design principles from the provided GitLab repository, I can refine the Low-Level Design (LLD) for a Cricbuzz-like application. Below is an updated and more detailed design, incorporating concepts from the repository.

1. Core Components
The system can be broken down into the following core components:

Match Management:

Handles match schedules, live scores, and match details.

Player and Team Management:

Manages player and team information.

Commentary System:

Provides ball-by-ball commentary for live matches.

News and Articles:

Manages cricket-related news and articles.

User Management:

Handles user profiles, preferences, and notifications.

Notification System:

Sends real-time notifications for match updates and news.
