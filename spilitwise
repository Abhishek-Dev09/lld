Designing a database schema and API flow for a system like Splitwise involves understanding the core functionalities of the application. Splitwise is a tool that helps users split expenses with friends, family, or groups. Below is a low-level design for the database schema and API flow.

Database Schema
The database schema should support the following key entities:

Users: To store user information.

Groups: To manage groups of users.

Expenses: To track individual expenses.

Balances: To track balances between users.

Tables
Users

user_id (Primary Key)

name

email

password_hash

created_at

updated_at

Groups

group_id (Primary Key)

name

created_by (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

created_at

updated_at

Group_Members

group_id (Foreign Key to Groups.group_id)

user_id (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

joined_at

(Composite Primary Key: group_id, user_id)

Expenses

expense_id (Primary Key)

description

amount

paid_by (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

group_id (Foreign Key to Groups.group_id, nullable for non-group expenses)

created_at

updated_at

Expense_Shares

expense_id (Foreign Key to Expenses.expense_id)

user_id (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

share_amount

(Composite Primary Key: expense_id, user_id)

Balances

user1_id (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

user2_id (Foreign Key to Users.user_id)

balance_amount (Positive if user1 owes user2, negative if user2 owes user1)

(Composite Primary Key: user1_id, user2_id)

API Flow
The API flow should support the following key operations:

User Management: Register, login, and fetch user details.

Group Management: Create groups, add/remove members, and fetch group details.

Expense Management: Add expenses, split expenses, and fetch expense details.

Balance Management: Fetch balances between users.

API Endpoints
User Management

POST /register - Register a new user.

Request Body: { "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com", "password": "password123" }

Response: { "user_id": 1, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }

POST /login - Login a user.

Request Body: { "email": "john@example.com", "password": "password123" }

Response: { "token": "jwt_token" }

GET /users/{user_id} - Fetch user details.

Response: { "user_id": 1, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }

Group Management

POST /groups - Create a new group.

Request Body: { "name": "Trip to Paris", "created_by": 1 }

Response: { "group_id": 1, "name": "Trip to Paris", "created_by": 1 }

POST /groups/{group_id}/members - Add a member to a group.

Request Body: { "user_id": 2 }

Response: { "group_id": 1, "user_id": 2 }

GET /groups/{group_id} - Fetch group details.

Response: { "group_id": 1, "name": "Trip to Paris", "members": [ { "user_id": 1, "name": "John" }, { "user_id": 2, "name": "Jane" } ] }

Expense Management

POST /expenses - Add a new expense.

Request Body: { "description": "Dinner", "amount": 100, "paid_by": 1, "group_id": 1, "shares": [ { "user_id": 1, "share_amount": 50 }, { "user_id": 2, "share_amount": 50 } ] }

Response: { "expense_id": 1, "description": "Dinner", "amount": 100, "paid_by": 1 }

GET /expenses/{expense_id} - Fetch expense details.

Response: { "expense_id": 1, "description": "Dinner", "amount": 100, "paid_by": 1, "shares": [ { "user_id": 1, "share_amount": 50 }, { "user_id": 2, "share_amount": 50 } ] }

Balance Management

GET /balances/{user_id} - Fetch balances for a user.

Response: { "user_id": 1, "balances": [ { "user_id": 2, "balance_amount": 50 } ] }

Low-Level Design Considerations
Database Indexing:

Index user_id in Users, group_id in Groups, and expense_id in Expenses for faster lookups.

Composite indexes for Group_Members and Expense_Shares to optimize group and expense-related queries.

API Authentication:

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints.

Concurrency Handling:

Use database transactions for operations like adding expenses and updating balances to ensure consistency.

Scalability:

Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like user balances.

Partition the database by user_id or group_id for horizontal scaling.

Error Handling:

Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

Include error messages in the response body for debugging.

Example Workflow
User Registration:

User registers via /register.

User logs in via /login and receives a JWT token.

Group Creation:

User creates a group via /groups.

User adds members to the group via /groups/{group_id}/members.

Expense Creation:

User adds an expense via /expenses.

The system calculates shares and updates balances in the Balances table.

Fetching Balances:

User fetches their balances via /balances/{user_id}.

what is arch flow and api
The architecture flow and API design are critical components of building a system like Splitwise. Below, I'll break down the architecture flow (how the system components interact) and the API design (how the endpoints are structured and used).

Architecture Flow
The architecture flow describes how different components of the system interact with each other to fulfill user requests. For a Splitwise-like application, the architecture can be divided into the following layers:

1. Client Layer
Frontend: Web or mobile app where users interact with the system.

Responsibilities:

Render the UI for users to register, create groups, add expenses, and view balances.

Send API requests to the backend and handle responses.

2. API Gateway
Role: Acts as the entry point for all client requests.

Responsibilities:

Route requests to the appropriate microservices.

Handle authentication and authorization (e.g., validate JWT tokens).

Rate limiting and request throttling.

3. Application Layer (Microservices)
User Service:

Handles user registration, login, and profile management.

Endpoints: /register, /login, /users/{user_id}.

Group Service:

Manages group creation, adding/removing members, and fetching group details.

Endpoints: /groups, /groups/{group_id}/members, /groups/{group_id}.

Expense Service:

Handles expense creation, splitting, and fetching expense details.

Endpoints: /expenses, /expenses/{expense_id}.

Balance Service:

Manages balance calculations and fetching balances between users.

Endpoints: /balances/{user_id}.

4. Database Layer
Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):

Stores data for users, groups, expenses, and balances.

Tables: Users, Groups, Group_Members, Expenses, Expense_Shares, Balances.

Caching Layer (e.g., Redis):

Caches frequently accessed data like user balances or group details to reduce database load.

5. Notification Service
Role: Sends notifications to users (e.g., when added to a group or when a new expense is added).

Integration: Can use email, SMS, or push notifications.

API Design
The API design defines the endpoints, request/response structures, and how clients interact with the backend. Below is a detailed API design for Splitwise:
