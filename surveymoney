    {"option_id": 3, "option_text": "Neutral"},
    {"option_id": 4, "option_text": "Dissatisfied"},
    {"option_id": 5, "option_text": "Very Dissatisfied"}
  ],
  "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:05:00Z"
}
3. Submit a Response
Endpoint: POST /surveys/{survey_id}/responses

Request Body:

json
Copy
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "responses": [
    {
      "question_id": 1,
      "option_id": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": 2,
      "response_text": "I love your service!"
    }
  ]
}
Response:

json
Copy
{
  "response_id": 1,
  "survey_id": 1,
  "user_id": 2,
  "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:10:00Z"
}
Summary
Database Schema: Designed tables for users, surveys, questions, options, and responses.

API Flow: Created endpoints for creating surveys, adding questions, and submitting responses.

This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional factors like authentication, validation, error handling, and more complex querying and reporting needs.

what is high level arch flow?
The high-level architecture flow of a system like SurveyMonkey (or any survey application) provides an overview of how different components interact to deliver the functionality. It focuses on the key components, their responsibilities, and how they communicate with each other. Below is a high-level architecture flow for a survey application:

High-Level Architecture Flow
1. Client Layer (Frontend)
Web Application: Built using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Mobile Application: Native (Swift, Kotlin) or cross-platform (Flutter, React Native).

Responsibilities:

Render the user interface (UI) for creating surveys, answering questions, and viewing results.

Handle user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms).

Communicate with the backend via APIs.

2. API Gateway
Purpose: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

Responsibilities:

Route requests to the appropriate microservices.

Handle authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT validation).

Rate limiting and request throttling.

Logging and monitoring.

3. Backend Services (Microservices)
The backend is divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality:

User Service:

Manages user authentication, registration, and profile information.

Stores user data in the User Database.

Handles login, signup, and password reset.

Survey Service:

Handles survey creation, editing, and deletion.

Stores survey metadata (title, description, etc.) in the Survey Database.

Manages relationships between surveys and questions.

Question Service:

Manages questions and their options (e.g., multiple-choice, text-based).

Stores question data in the Question Database.

Validates question types and options.

Response Service:

Handles survey responses submitted by users.

Stores responses in the Response Database.

Ensures data integrity (e.g., one response per user per survey).

Analytics Service:

Processes survey response data to generate insights (e.g., charts, statistics).

Stores aggregated data in the Analytics Database.

Provides APIs for fetching reports and dashboards.

4. Databases
User Database: Stores user information (e.g., username, email, password hash).

Survey Database: Stores survey metadata (e.g., title, description, creator).

Question Database: Stores questions and their options.

Response Database: Stores user responses to surveys.

Analytics Database: Stores precomputed analytics data for fast retrieval.

5. Message Queue (Optional)
Purpose: Handles asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending emails, generating reports).

Example: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka.

Use Case:

When a user submits a response, the Response Service publishes an event to the message queue.

The Analytics Service consumes the event and updates the analytics data.

6. Cache Layer
Purpose: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.

Example: Redis, Memcached.

Use Cases:

Cache survey metadata for faster loading.

Cache precomputed analytics data for dashboards.

7. Storage Layer
Purpose: Stores files (e.g., images, documents) uploaded by users.

Example: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.

Use Case:

If a survey allows image uploads as part of a response, the files are stored here.

8. Notification Service
Purpose: Sends notifications (e.g., email, SMS) to users.

Example:

Notify survey creators when a response is submitted.

Send reminders to users to complete surveys.

9. Monitoring and Logging
Purpose: Ensures the system is running smoothly and helps debug issues.

Tools:

Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.

Error Tracking: Sentry or Rollbar.

High-Level Flow
User Interaction:

A user logs in via the Client Layer (web or mobile app).

The request is routed through the API Gateway to the User Service for authentication.

Survey Creation:

The user creates a survey using the Survey Service.

Questions are added using the Question Service.

Data is stored in the Survey Database and Question Database.

Survey Response:

A respondent submits a response via the Client Layer.

The Response Service processes the response and stores it in the Response Database.

An event is published to the Message Queue for the Analytics Service to process.

Analytics and Reporting:

The Analytics Service processes the response data and updates the Analytics Database.

The user views survey results and insights via the Client Layer.

Notifications:

The Notification Service sends emails or SMS to users (e.g., survey reminders, response alerts).

Key Considerations
Scalability: Use load balancers, caching, and database sharding to handle high traffic.

Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

Performance: Optimize database queries and use caching for frequently accessed data.

Fault Tolerance: Use retries, circuit breakers, and redundancy to ensure system reliability.

This high-level architecture flow provides a scalable, modular, and maintainable design for a survey application like SurveyMonkey.

how flow of survey creation works?
The flow of survey creation in a system like SurveyMonkey involves multiple steps and interactions between the client (frontend), backend services, and databases. Below is a detailed explanation of how this flow works:

Survey Creation Flow
1. User Authentication
Step: The user logs in to the application.

Flow:

The client (web or mobile app) sends a login request to the API Gateway.

The API Gateway routes the request to the User Service.

The User Service validates the credentials and returns a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

The client stores the JWT and includes it in subsequent requests.

2. Survey Creation Request
Step: The user initiates the creation of a new survey.

Flow:

The client sends a POST /surveys request to the API Gateway with the survey details (e.g., title, description).

The API Gateway validates the JWT and routes the request to the Survey Service.

The Survey Service:

Validates the request payload.

Creates a new survey record in the Survey Database.

Returns the survey_id to the client.

3. Adding Questions
Step: The user adds questions to the survey.

Flow:

For each question, the client sends a POST /surveys/{survey_id}/questions request to the API Gateway.

The API Gateway validates the JWT and routes the request to the Question Service.

The Question Service:

Validates the question data (e.g., question text, type, options).

Creates a new question record in the Question Database.

Links the question to the survey using the survey_id.

Returns the question_id to the client.

4. Adding Options (for Multiple-Choice Questions)
Step: If the question type is multiple-choice, the user adds options.

Flow:

For each option, the client sends a POST /questions/{question_id}/options request to the API Gateway.

The API Gateway validates the JWT and routes the request to the Question Service.

The Question Service:

Validates the option data (e.g., option text).

Creates a new option record in the Question Database.

Links the option to the question using the question_id.

Returns the option_id to the client.

5. Saving the Survey
Step: The user finalizes and saves the survey.

Flow:

The client sends a PUT /surveys/{survey_id} request to mark the survey as "complete."

The API Gateway validates the JWT and routes the request to the Survey Service.

The Survey Service:

Updates the survey status in the Survey Database.

Returns a success response to the client.

6. Publishing the Survey
Step: The user publishes the survey to make it available for responses.

Flow:

The client sends a POST /surveys/{survey_id}/publish request to the API Gateway.

The API Gateway validates the JWT and routes the request to the Survey Service.

The Survey Service:

Updates the survey status to "published" in the Survey Database.

Triggers a notification (via the Notification Service) to inform the user that the survey is live.

Returns a success response to the client.

}
Key Considerations
Validation:

Ensure all inputs (e.g., survey title, question text, options) are validated to prevent invalid data.

Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid survey ID, missing fields).

Atomicity:

Use database transactions to ensure data consistency (e.g., if adding a question fails, roll back the entire operation).

Performance:

Optimize database queries and use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., survey metadata).

Security:

Validate JWT tokens and ensure only authorized users can create or modify surveys.

This flow ensures a smooth and efficient process for survey creation, from initial setup to publishing.

how the end user flow looks like
The end-user flow in a survey application like SurveyMonkey refers to the steps a respondent (end-user) takes to find, complete, and submit a survey. This flow is distinct from the survey creator's flow and focuses on simplicity, usability, and responsiveness. Below is a detailed explanation of the end-user flow:

End-User Flow
1. Accessing the Survey
Step: The end-user receives a link to the survey.

Flow:

The user clicks on the survey link (e.g., shared via email, SMS, or social media).

The link redirects the user to the survey page hosted on the application.

2. Landing Page
Step: The user lands on the survey introduction page.

Flow:

The client (web or mobile app) fetches survey metadata (e.g., title, description) from the Survey Service via the API Gateway.

The survey details are displayed to the user.

The user clicks a "Start Survey" button to begin.

3. Answering Questions
Step: The user answers the survey questions one by one.

Flow:

The client fetches the first question and its options (if applicable) from the Question Service via the API Gateway.

The user provides an answer:

For multiple-choice questions, the user selects an option.

For text-based questions, the user types a response.

The client validates the response locally (e.g., ensuring a required question is answered).

The user clicks "Next" to proceed to the next question.

Steps 1–4 repeat until all questions are answered.

4. Review and Submit
Step: The user reviews their responses and submits the survey.

Flow:

The client displays a summary of all responses for review.

The user confirms and clicks "Submit."

The client sends the responses to the Response Service via the API Gateway.

The Response Service:

Validates the responses.

Stores the responses in the Response Database.

Triggers an event (e.g., via a Message Queue) to notify the Analytics Service for processing.

The client displays a "Thank You" page to the user.

5. Post-Submission (Optional)
Step: The user may receive a confirmation or follow-up.

Flow:

The Notification Service sends a confirmation email or SMS to the user (if configured by the survey creator).

The user may be redirected to a custom "Thank You" page or prompted to share the survey with others.

Use responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

Validation:

Validate responses on the client side (e.g., ensure required questions are answered).

Revalidate on the server side to prevent invalid data.

Performance:

Optimize API calls to fetch questions and options (e.g., pagination for long surveys).

Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., survey metadata).

Security:

Prevent unauthorized access to surveys (e.g., use unique survey links or authentication).

Ensure data privacy (e.g., anonymize responses if required).

Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., display a friendly message if the survey fails to load).

Example User Interface Flow
Landing Page:

Survey Title: "Customer Feedback Survey"

Description: "Please share your feedback."

Button: "Start Survey"

Question Page:

Question: "How satisfied are you with our service?"

Options: Radio buttons for "Very Satisfied," "Satisfied," etc.

Buttons: "Previous" (disabled for the first question) and "Next."

Review Page:

Summary of responses:

"How satisfied are you with our service?" → "Very Satisfied"

"Any additional comments?" → "Great service!"

Button: "Submit"

Thank You Page:

Message: "Thank you for completing the survey!"

Optional: "Share this survey with others."

This end-user flow ensures a seamless and engaging experience for respondents, encouraging higher completion rates and accurate responses.

Use a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data (users, surveys, questions, options, responses).

Use a NoSQL database (MongoDB) or data warehouse (Amazon Redshift) for analytics and reporting.

Use an in-memory database (Redis) for caching frequently accessed data.

Use object storage (Amazon S3) for file uploads.

This combination ensures scalability, performance, and flexibility for a survey application like SurveyMonkey.
